# CreepCureveFit
Fitting of creep equation parameters for primary creep (Modified Time Hardening) eqantion.

The code was created in Jupitr Notebooc (Python 3).

The code allows you to fit the coefficients of the creep equation from experimental data.
Modified time hardening has four coefficients. C4 is for temperature dependency. If you do not have temperature-dependent data, fix C4 to zero.
